## Softnet Proxy

This is the source code for the Softnet Proxy server developed in .NET Framework 4.0. This server implements mechanisms for establishing TCP and UDP connections in peer-to-peer or proxy mode. To transfer data through TCP connections created in proxy mode, the server uses a new TCP-packet switching technology, which is much more efficient in terms of server resource requirements than TURN/TCP.
